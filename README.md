My Name is Wojciech Alex Wikiel, but I go by Alex.  My current professional role is as product development specialist at a plating chemical manufacture, but my business unit deals with analytical tools. Most of our metrology equipment we produce is used in the semiconductor industry.  I work with a small group of people, mostly chemists, but also engineers, and another programmer.  My responsibilities span from programming to interacting and troubleshooting with customers and even some managerial task.  I work on the tools themselves, developing software and changing program configurations.  I also do engineering tasks, like re-wiring and rebuilding subcomponents.  I have also spent some time as a field technician, which allowed me to experience some of the world traveling to many different customer sites.  Some of the countries I have visited  for work are, China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Costa Rica, France, and Germany.  In my personal life, I am husband and a father of two. My favorite pastimes include grilling and spending time by the ocean.  I also love to try new foods, especially the cuisines of other regions.
